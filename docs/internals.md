# gbforth internals

gbforth includes a Forth cross-compiler. The cross-compiler is missing many
optimizations and functionality but it is quite easy to work with. This document
gives an overview of how to improve it.

## Compiler

The entrypoint of the gbforth compiler can be found at `src/compiler/cross.fs`

This file implements the equivalent of the "outer interpreter" in Forth. In
particular, the word `x]` (cross-version of `]`), will switch to cross-compiling
mode, reading words and cross-compiling them. Note that this does not reuse the
host Forth outer interpreter.

gbforth compiles words into an [intermediate representation (IR)](https://github.com/ams-hackers/gbforth/blob/master/src/compiler/ir.fs).
This represents the code as a graph of IR components, each of them being a
sequence of IR nodes (e.g: CALL node to call another word), corresponding to the
traditional basic blocks in compiler terminology. Control flow like conditionals
and loops are implemented as links between those IR components.

This intermediate representation are saved together with cross-words, as defined
in [xname.fs](https://github.com/ams-hackers/gbforth/blob/master/src/compiler/xname.fs).
However, the code is not actually compiled into assembler in the ROM just yet.

On the intermediate representation, some optimizations can take place. There are
no optimizations in place yet, but you can see an example of how tail-call
[optimization could be implemented](https://github.com/ams-hackers/gbforth/blob/master/src/compiler/optimize.fs).

Once the whole game source code has been processed, we have a collection of
xnames, linked to IR or code primitives. In order to produce the ROM, the
[code generator](https://github.com/ams-hackers/gbforth/blob/master/src/compiler/codegen.fs)
is invoked on the special word `main`. This, in turn, will invoke recursively
the code generator for any word that is required by main, and so on. This means
that only words that you actually use are included in the ROM, saving
considerable space. There are other ways of forcing a word code to be generated,
for example, trying to get its address (`' dup constant dup-addr`).

As a consequence, we are free to define as many words in libraries as we like
without affecting users that are not using them.

### Playing with the compiler

You can see the intermediate representation of a word with the word `xsee`.
There is a file `src/compiler/debug.fs` which you can change easily and run it
with `gforth src/compiler/debug.fs` while you make changes to the compiler.
