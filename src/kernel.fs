( Assume you have the following code

  : double dup + ;
  : quadruple double double ;

  This kernel uses subroutine-threading Forth. The picture below
  illustrates how the compiled words would look like:

              +------
              |  ...                            DUP [asm]
              +------
                ^
                |
               /
       +----------+--------+------+
       | CALL dup | CALL + | RET  |             DOUBLE
       +----------+--------+------+
         ^
         \____________________
                              \
       +-------------+-------------+-----+
       | CALL double | CALL double | RET |      QUADRUPLE
       +-------------+-------------+-----+

  For all colon definitions, the code field simply contains CALLs to
  every word [or primitive] address that is part of the word definition.

  Those are primitive [code] words written in dmg-forth.
